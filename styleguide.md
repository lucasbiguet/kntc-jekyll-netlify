          We didn’t know each other very well, as we only met through social media, so we decided to take time to jam a bit, each proposing a song to cover, testing the alchemy. We realized that we easily played together, so we started writing our own stuff, and that led to our first EP.
          My former band was more instinctive, each one bringing their ideas, we didn’t have any leader, without implying that there’s one now, we wouldn’t take time to work deeply on our songs, to re-arrange, to focus on an artistic direction.
